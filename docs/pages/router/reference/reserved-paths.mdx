title: Reserved paths
description: URL paths reserved by Metro and Expo Router that you should avoid using for routes or static files.

import { FileTree } from '~/ui/components/FileTree';

If you create a route or place static files at certain URL paths, Metro or Expo Router will intercept the request instead of serving your content. This typically results in a "404 Asset not found" error during development.

## `/assets/*`

Metro serves all bundled assets (images, fonts, and other files) at this path. If you create a route at **app/assets.tsx** or a directory at **public/assets/**, Metro intercepts the request and your content is never reached.

This applies to both top-level routes and static files:

<FileTree
  files={[
    ['app/assets.tsx', 'Conflicts with Metro'],
    ['app/assets/index.tsx', 'Conflicts with Metro'],
    ['public/assets/logo.png', 'Conflicts with Metro'],
  ]}
/>

Rename your route or directory to avoid the conflict:

<FileTree
  files={[
    ['app/media.tsx', 'Works'],
    ['public/images/logo.png', 'Works'],
  ]}
/>

## `/_expo/*`

Expo Router uses this path for multiple internal middlewares, including dev tools and manifests. Do not create routes or static files under this path.

## `/_flight/*`

React Server Components use this path internally. Do not create routes or static files under this path.

## `/inspector`

React Native uses `/inspector/debug` and `/inspector/network` for the debugger. Avoid creating routes that match `/inspector` or its sub-paths.

## `/expo-dev-plugins/*`

Expo development tool plugins use this path. Do not create routes or static files under this path.

## `/public/*`

If your project has a **public** directory, the `/public` URL path may conflict with static file serving. Avoid creating a route at **app/public.tsx** or **app/public/index.tsx** since the path is implicitly reserved when the **public** directory exists.

## `/favicon.ico`

Unlike the paths above, `/favicon.ico` is safe to override. Expo CLI serves a default favicon when none is provided. You can replace it by placing a **favicon.ico** file in your **public** directory or by creating an [API route](/router/web/api-routes/).
