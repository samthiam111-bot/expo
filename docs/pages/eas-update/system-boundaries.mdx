description: Learn about the key constraints of the EAS Update system.

EAS Update provides JavaScript, images, fonts, and other assets to your app. It does not change the self-contained contents of your native app and its signed binary, which include:

- Native modules included in the binary
- Platform entitlements and provisioning profiles
- Declared system permissions
- Compiled frameworks and native code
- Background modes and OS-level capabilities
- App identity and embedded configuration (bundle ID/package name, app name/short name, URL schemes/deep-link schemes)
- Build-time resources (app icon, launch screen)

Updates always run inside the runtime environment defined by the original binary.

## JavaScript and Hermes Bytecode

Updates may be delivered as:

- JavaScript source code
- JavaScript bytecode for the [Hermes engine](https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes)

In both cases, the code runs inside the JavaScript engine that was compiled into the app at build time.

Updates do not:

- Introduce native code
- Replace the JavaScript engine
- Modify system capabilities

Hermes bytecode is simply an optimized format of JavaScript that improves startup performance. It runs within the same runtime boundaries as standard JavaScript.

## Native compatibility

Each [EAS Build](/build/introduction/) is associated with a specific native runtime. Updates must stay compatible with:

- The native modules included in the binary
- The APIs those modules expose
- The capabilities declared at build time

If you need to change native functionality, you must create a new build.

You can use [Expo Fingerprint](/versions/latest/sdk/fingerprint) to track whether changes in your project affect the native runtime (for example, adding/removing native dependencies or changing native configuration). When the fingerprint changes, it’s a strong signal you should produce a new build rather than shipping an update.
