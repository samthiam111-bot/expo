import { APIInstallSection } from '~/components/plugins/InstallSection';

> **important** **This library is currently in alpha and will frequently experience breaking changes.** It is not available in the Expo Go app &mdash; use [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) to try it out.

The Jetpack Compose components in `@expo/ui/jetpack-compose` allow you to build fully native Android interfaces using Jetpack Compose from React Native.

## Installation

<APIInstallSection />

## Usage

Using a component from `@expo/ui/jetpack-compose` requires wrapping it in a [`Host`](./host) component. The `Host` is a container for Jetpack Compose views.

```tsx
import { Host, Button } from '@expo/ui/jetpack-compose';

export function SaveButton() {
  return (
    <Host matchContents>
      <Button onPress={() => alert('Saved!')}>Save changes</Button>
    </Host>
  );
}
```
