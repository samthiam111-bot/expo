    # Runtime is an abstract C++ class with pure virtual methods (not callable on
    # Swift value types) and is managed externally. Import as an immortal reference
    # type (SWIFT_IMMORTAL_REFERENCE) so Swift treats it like a class without
    # attempting to manage its lifetime via retain/release.
